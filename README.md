# Project Title: Monet Style Image Generation using GANs

## Description:
This project focuses on generating images in the style of Claude Monet, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs comprise two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to produce images resembling Monet's paintings, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images.

### To run this project locally:

- Install the dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).
- Download the dataset
- Run the notebook cells one by on to train the GAN model on the Monet images dataset.
- Adjust hyperparameters or model architecture as needed for experimentation.
- Generate Monet-style images using the trained generator network.
- Evaluate the generated images based on their similarity to Monet's style.


### Results:
The trained GAN model successfully generates images resembling Monet's style. Through iterative refinement and multiple submissions, a score of 126.79174 was achieved on the Kaggle dashboard.
